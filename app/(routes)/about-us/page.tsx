            The Cheshire smile, huge chubby cheeks and the plush look of a
            British Shorthair coat are so-called trademarks of this breed. This
            together with their known wonderful disposition towards children and
            all members of the family makes them best pets you can ever dream
            about.

          <p className="pb-4">
            We breed the following colours in solid: Traditional Blue, rare
            Lilac and Chocolate, and exclusive colours of Cinnamon and Fawn, the
            first and only in Canada! All our cats have high titled
            representatives of British breed in their pedigrees and carry world
            famous bloodlines such as: Coppins, Lion King, Pepper King,
            Scorpions, Catwalkâ€™s and many others... Our aim is to breed healthy,
            happy, affectionate British Shorthair cats that are of excellent
            type and superb temperament making them exceptional family pets. We

            We focus firstly on health. All our cats are FIV, PKD and FeLV free
            and blood tested. Our goals as breeders are to produce British true
            to standards, aiming for that dense soft coat, strong solid body,
            large round head, small ears and those beautiful round copper eyes
            that draw you in, like a moth to a light. As a hobby breeder all our
            British shorthairs are much loved family pets and all our British
            kittens are born and raised in our home and are given lots of
            cuddles and love from birth.

            We breed for quality not quantity, so this means we only have a
            limited number of British Shorthair kittens available every year and
            have a waiting list of new owners ready to adopt kittens. Be our
            dear guest and have a look at what&apos;s next on our pages, and if
            you have discovered that you are one of us, fans of furry British
            teddy bears, always feel free to contact us about purchasing an
            &quot;Aurore De La Vie&quot; kitten, or if you need more information
            about those wonderful animals!
