            <span className="pl-8">So</span> the decision is made – you are
            purchasing a kitten! A beautiful one. Like the one you have seen in
            advertisement on TV recently. A highbred, with passport, sorry, with
            rather ancestry of 5 generations. And, of course, a healthy one,
            with a veterinary passport, with vaccination marks. You dial the
            advertised number of the nursery and find out the price of a kitten;
            and…
          </p>

          <p className="pb-4">
            Well, it&apos;s not that you&apos;re sparing money, but it&apos;s
            just not understandable, what are you paying so such money for?
            Let&apos;s start with the point that you haven&apos;t gone to a pet
            shop or a pet market for your kitten, you haven&apos;t bought it in
            a subway passage. You have called a nursery. You&apos;ve contacted
            professionals, the people who know what, when and how much to buy,
            give, and do in order to let you enjoy beauty, harm, tenderness and
            affection of your pet. You may often hear that yard cats get rarely
            ill and live long. It is possible. Possible, but: - you
            shouldn&apos;t forget that it can be said only about cats, older
            than one year old; only these cats have passed terrible natural
            selection; but if a kitten younger than 2 months (and they are sold
            at pet markets and in the subway at this age), it is unknown,
            whether it would live more than a year; - purchasing a kitten in the
            unknown place, you would never know, whether it&apos;s a pure breed,
            what character it might have; - you wouldn&apos;t get a certificate
            of your kitten&apos;s health, veterinary passport or any data of
            previous vaccination.
          </p>

          <p className="pb-4">
            People, who are engaged in breeding (note: in breeding, but not in
            multiplication), are also called &quot;breeders&quot;. In my
            opinion, it is correct. A nursery is some kind of a factory. The
            factory with its own production, laboratories, economy and
            accountancy. The factory with its rules of work, which are called
            &quot;The International Standard of the Breed&quot;. Every breeder
            is obliged to know his breed&apos;s standard, only than we might
            speak of breeding, but not multiplying. If you don&apos;t know the
            standard, you don&apos;t know disadvantages of your own kittens, and
            you don&apos;t know how to improve them. Accurate plan of mating,
            laborious selection of breeders, careful study of ancestries,
            advantages and disadvantages, selection of genetic lines – all of
            this reminds of researches in factory laboratories.

          <p className="pb-4">
            The next component of the price is tightly connected with the first
            one, it can be even said that it results from the first component –
            the level of breeder&apos;s professionalism. This is the breeding
            quality. The level of breeding quality depends on phenotype and
            genotype. The phenotype reflects the accordance of an animal to the
            international breed standard. If we speak about price formation, all
            animals can be conditionally divided into three types:
            <ul className="list-disc ml-12 pt-2">
              <li>Show-class</li>

              <li>
                Animals, which mostly correspond the requirements of the breed
                standard;
              </li>

              <li>Breed-class</li>

              <li>
                Cats (only female!), which have several very insignificant
                disadvantages, which wouldn&apos;t let get the highest
                qualification at exhibitions, but they would be able to deliver
                wonderful offspring;
              </li>

              <li>
                Pet-class – &quot;a cat for a pillow&quot;, just a pet. Usually
                pet-class includes male cats, which can&apos;t be defined as
                show-class, and that is why wouldn&apos;t make a successful
                exhibition career, as judges are always very strict in
                estimation of male cats – breeders.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p className="pb-4">
            So the price for a kitten depends on the class, it refers to. A
            genotype shows pure bred in kittens ancestry, which ancestors it
            has, which new blood and in which generation were added. The main
            item which needs to be mentioned is that &quot;the price of the
            question&quot; depends on kitten&apos;s genotype as well, so at
            purchasing it wouldn&apos;t be odd to study carefully the
            kitten&apos;s ancestry, although it wouldn&apos;t be very useful
            among beginners in breeding.
          </p>

          <p className="pb-4">
            The next component of the price directly depends on what was
            mentioned earlier – gaining breeders for the nursery. I hope that
            our discussion about breeding quality, which we performed earlier,
            would let not speak long about the influence of the breeders&apos;
            cost on kittens&apos; price. They cost a lot. And as the Canadian
            market of breeders doesn&apos;t always satisfy experienced breeders
            because of various reasons, they have to buy breeders abroad, that
            naturally increases the expenses on the purchase greatly (tickets,
            visa, hotel, etc.). Growing breeders (as well as growing kittens) is
            another price component. In order to have a healthy and fit kitten,
            proper food is necessary. This feeding can be gained in two ways:
            professional or natural food. In the aim of good growth of our pet
            we need dry and canned food. Food of super-premium class (Royal
            Canin, Hills, Yams, Eukanuba) cost very expensive...
          </p>

          <p className="pb-4">
            Exhibitions. That&apos;s the only place where you can get objective
            estimation of what you have purchased and grown. Only there you may
            get the breeding quality of your pets estimated. Exhibitions are
            titles, ranks. This is an important part in your pet&apos;s
            ancestry. Exhibitions include financial expenses, another component
            of the kitten&apos;s price. It includes the cost of veterinarian
            conclusion, the cost of expertise at an exhibition, the cost of
            veterinarian control. If an exhibition is in another city, then add
            the cost of train or plane tickets, hotel room.
          </p>

          <p className="pb-4">
            Health of a kitten is one of the main reasons, why you attend a
            nursery, but not a pet market. And this is the next component of
            kitten&apos;s price. The term &quot;health&quot; includes many
            components. First of all, vaccination. A kitten gets the first set
            of vaccines (twice) at the age of 8-12 weeks. Mature cats need
            vaccination once a year. Secondly, regular veterinary examination.
            It includes not only regular procedures (for example, antihelminthic
            arrangement), but also emergencies (for example, the caesarean
            section at delivery).Health requires expenses.
          </p>

          <p className="pb-4">
            Separately, I&apos;d like to say about nursery equipment. In a good
            nursery there are plenty of things – from a mouse till a scratching
            post. … Even in case when a nursery has its own cat-breeder,
            sometimes for the sake of selection you have to take your female
            cats to another nurseries for mating. The cost of mating is another
            component of kitten&apos;s price. You can&apos;t avoid another point
            of expenses – advertisement. Unfortunately, we all are the children
            of our era, and a nowadays advertisement is a trade motor. Not a
            cheap one. I tried to list very briefly the main components, which
            influence the kitten&apos;s price. And the approach of price
            formation is, in my opinion, similar everywhere.
